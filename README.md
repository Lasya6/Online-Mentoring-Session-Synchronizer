# Online-Mentoring-Session-Synchronizer
This is a session synchronizer which is used by applications that permits only an individual to attend the session while others are directed to study room.
Problem Statement
An online mentoring scenario where a tutor teaches online. If no student is present,
he works on his laptop, otherwise he teaches one student at a time. After all students
in the room have been taught, the tutor calls the day off.
